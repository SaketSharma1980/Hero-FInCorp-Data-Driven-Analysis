# Hero-FInCorp-Data-Driven-Analysis
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Hero FinCorp's lending data, aiming to uncover patterns in default behavior, assess transaction performance, and evaluate branch-level efficiencies using python
Key insights include:

Early defaults are linked with lower credit scores and shorter tenures.
Irregular repayments and high penalty ratios signal rising risk.
Branches in certain regions show higher default and lower recovery performance.
Transaction behaviors differ significantly between overdue and non-overdue loans.
Based on these findings, we propose targeted risk scoring, improved collection strategies, and branch-level interventions to improve portfolio health and profitability.
